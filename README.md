# AutoPDF
AutoPDF is a program to help convert pictures into pdf.

During these Corona Times, we have to submit all our assignments, homeworks and sometimes tests online by converting them into pdf. Mostly such services are found online, we have even tried multiple other apps used for similar purposes but found none to be satisfactory. Hence, we decided to make our own.
